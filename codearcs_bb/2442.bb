; Title: Mesh Based Particle Lib
; Description: Particle system using meshes, sounds, and paths

It has min documentation (flung together remember) so if you dont get how im doing somthing, just ask.

The test program simply shows some of the features such as.
 Aligning particle effects to meet collision angles,
 parenting several emitters together, applying paths to
 emitters and objects that are parents to emitters, as well
 as showing the visual difference betwen parent and
 superparent flags. (superparent means every particle is
 also parented to emitter or main parent). Sound management
 is integrated into the particle system so you dont have to
 worry about that at all, you just indicate sounds in the
 emitter presets
